# Wave Function Collapse
 
 my own try at the implementation of the wave function collapse.
 the goal is to implement a version of the function using sockets.
 - sudoku contains an implementation of the function for sudoku solving.
 - socket contains an implementation of the function using sockets, to generate a landscape using tiles.
